Power Query feature in MS ExcelPower Query feature in MS Excel
In this project I have used the Power Query tool in MS Excel and performed ETL task before loading it into MS Excel. 
Various methods such as Add columns (From Selection) , Merge multiple Queries, Split Columns( based on delimiters, spaces and other conditions), 
updating the existing Power Query with new data and simulataneously reflect it back in the Excel dashboard and IF conditions to add Bonus 
attribute to the workbook were experimented. Additionally importing data from a web source directly into the Power Query platform was experimented.
